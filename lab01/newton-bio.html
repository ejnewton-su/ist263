</head>

<body>
Hi, I am Eli Newton, and I am a junior at Syracuse University majoring in Supply Chain Management & Finance, while minoring in IMT & Sociology. I am interested in supply chain logisitics professionally, mostly in the area of problem solving regarding sourcing. 
<br>
<br>
I am an active member of the Syracuse Community, being active members in both the Entrepreneurship Club and Real Estate Clubs. I am also a brother of the professional business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi, holding multiple executive positions over the course of the last semesters. 
<br>
I have also been a Peer Mentor for the Whitman School of Management, helping freshmen acclimate into college life. 
<br>
<br>
Some of my interests outside of school include swimming, hiking, playing the piano, and watching Formula One. 
<br>
I grew up in the outdoors of Connecticut, so I have always loved the tranquility that comes from the outdoors.
<br>
Additionally, I was a varsity swimmer in high school so I have always loved the water and how much of a stress reliever swimming has become in my life.
